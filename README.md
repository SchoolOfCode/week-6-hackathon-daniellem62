The Trials of the Oracle
Captured in the heart of the ancient Kata Forests, you find yourself trapped in a dark, enigmatic chamber. The room is silent except for the voice of a mysterious oracle. It looms over you, demanding proof of your coding prowess. A fan of The New York Times' infamous games, the oracle is particularly fond of challenges that tease the brain, like Wordle, Sudoku, and Connections. To escape, you must outsmart the oracle by conquering its three trials. Each trial reveals a fragment of the key to your freedom.

🌟 Trial 1: The Number Enigma
The Oracle whispers a secret number between 1 and 100, and it’s up to you to implement 
the logic that determines how close a guess is to the secret number. Decipher its hints
 to unveil the correct number and prove your skills:

🟩 "You got it!" – The guess matches the oracle's secret.
🔺 "Too high!" – The guess is higher than the secret number.
🔻 "Too low!" – The guess is lower than the secret number.
🚨 "Way too high!" – The guess exceeds the secret number by more than 20.
🚨 "Way too low!" – The guess is more than 20 below the secret number.
❗ "Please enter a number between 1 and 100." – Invalid input is not tolerated.

Complete this trial by writing logic that handles all edge cases and passes the oracle's tests.
If you pass the Oracle's test, move on to Trial 2:

🕹 Features
Random Oracle Secrets: Generate and process random numbers, Connections grids, and Wordle words.

Guided Feedback: Intuitive responses to aid in deciphering the Oracle's challenges.

Edge Case Protection: Handles invalid or unexpected inputs gracefully.

Replay Option: Test your skills repeatedly to refine your solutions.
🚀 How to Solve
Clone the Oracle's Domain:

git clone 
Install the Oracle's Tools:

npm install
Run the Tests:

npm run test
Implement the logic for each trial in the appropriate file and ensure all tests pass. Use the test feedback to refine your solutions.

📖 Behind the Code
The oracle’s secrets are powered by:

JavaScript: The language of logic and riddles.

Vitest: Ensuring the oracle never falters.

Node.js: The gateway to the Oracle's realm.

💡 Acknowledgments
This project was created for the Kata Hackathon with the aim of blending problem-solving, fun, and creativity. Inspired by the classic number-guessing game and enhanced with a touch of mystery.

Outsmart the oracle, pass its trials, and escape the chamber. Your freedom awaits—if you’re clever enough to earn it.
