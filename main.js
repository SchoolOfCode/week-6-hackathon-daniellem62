/*The Trials of the Oracle

Captured in the heart of the ancient Kata Forests, you find yourself trapped in a dark, enigmatic chamber. 
The room is silent except for the voice of a mysterious oracle. It looms over you, demanding proof of
your coding prowess. A fan of The New York Times' infamous games, the oracle is particularly fond of 
challenges that tease the brain, like Wordle, Sudoku, and Connections. To escape, you must outsmart 
the oracle by conquering its three trials. 

Each trial reveals a fragment of the key to your freedom. Good luck! */
